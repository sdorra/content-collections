title: Serialization
---

The resulting document of a collection is serialized before being written to the file system. This process ensures the document can be stored in a file and later read back into memory. To serialize the document, the resulting object must be serializable, meaning it can only consist of the following types:

* String
* Number
* Boolean
* Null
* Undefined
* Date
* Map
* Set
* BigInt
* Array of serializable types
* Object with serializable values
