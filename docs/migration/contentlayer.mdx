Content Collection was build as an alternative to the awesome [Contentlayer](https://contentlayer.dev/),
you can read more [here](https://sdorra.dev/posts/2024-01-15-content-collections).
If you are coming from Contentlayer, you can migrate easily to Content Collection.
The concepts are similar, but there are some differences.

## Fields

Content Collections uses a [schema](/docs/configuration#schema) to define the fields of a collection.
Computed fields can be added with the [transform](/docs/transform) function.

## Content

In contentlayer you have to define if a collection is of type `markdown` or `mdx`.
Content Collections does not parse or compile the content of a file.
The content is just a string.
But it offers a [transform](/docs/transform) function,
which can be used to transform the content before it is saved to the collection.
Please have a look at the [transform documentation](/docs/transform#content) for more information.

## \_raw vs \_meta

In Contentlayer, you can access the `_raw` field with file details. In Content Collections, there's a similar field named `_meta` for file information. When transitioning from Contentlayer to Content Collections, use the transform function to include a `_raw` field mirroring Contentlayer's structure in the document. This way, you won't need to modify your application code.

### Example

```ts
transform: (doc) => {
  return {
    ...doc,
    _raw: {
      sourceFilePath: doc._meta.filePath,
      sourceFileName: doc._meta.fileName,
      sourceFileDir: doc._meta.directory,
      flattenedPath: doc._meta.path,
      contentType: "mdx", // or markdown
    },
  };
},
```

## \_id

Each document in Contentlayer has a unique identifier called `_id`. Content Collections do not have an `id` field. The `_id` field in Contentlayer corresponds to the file path. By utilizing the transform function, we can assign the `filePath` from the `_meta` field as the `_id`.

### Example

```ts
transform: (doc) => {
  return {
    ...doc,
    _id: doc._meta.filePath,
  };
},
```
