<div className="step">

Install required packages:

We have to install the following packages:

- `@content-collections/core`
- `@content-collections/cli`
- `concurrently`
- `zod`

```package-install
npm i @content-collections/core @content-collections/cli concurrently zod -D
```

</div>
<div className="step">

Adjust your `tsconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    // ...
    "paths": {
      "content-collections": ["./.content-collections/generated"]
    }
  }
}
```

We require a path alias for the generated files.
This is necessary because the CLI will generate the files in the `.content-collections/generated` folder.

</div>
<div className="step">

Add the content-collection cli to your `package.json` scripts:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "concurrently \"content-collections watch\" \"build-scripts dev\"",
    "build": "content-collections build && build-scripts build"
  }
}
```

First, we modify the `dev` script to simultaneously execute the `content-collections watch` command along with our regular `dev` command.

Next, we execute the `content-collections build` command prior to our regular `build` command.

**Note:** Make sure to replace `build-scripts` with the appropriate command for your framework, such as `next` or `vite`.

</div>
<div className="step">

Add the new `.content-collections` directory to your project's `.gitignore` file — the files in this directory are always regenerated and can be safely ignored by Git.

```
.content-collections
```

</div>
<div className="step">

Create a `content-collections.ts` file at the root of your project:

```ts
import { defineCollection, defineConfig } from "@content-collections/core";
import { z } from "zod";

const posts = defineCollection({
  name: "posts",
  directory: "src/posts",
  include: "**/*.md",
  schema: z.object({
    title: z.string(),
    summary: z.string(),
  }),
});

export default defineConfig({
  collections: [posts],
});
```

This file defines a collection named `posts` in the `src/posts` folder.
The collection will include all markdown files (`**/*.md`) and the schema will validate the `title` and `summary` fields.

For more information about the configuration have a look at the [documentation](/docs/configuration).

</div>
<div className="step">

Create your content files (e.g.: `src/posts/hello-world.md`):

```md
---
title: "Hello world"
summary: "This is my first post!"
---

# Hello world

This is my first post!
... rest of the content
```

You can create unlimited content files.
These files will be validated against the schema defined in the `content-collections.ts` file.
If the files are valid, they will be automatically added to the `posts` collection.

</div>
<div className="step">
Usage in your code:

```tsx
import { allPosts } from "content-collections";
```

Now you can just import the `allPosts` collection and use it in your code.
The `allPosts` collection will contain all posts that are valid.
The `post` object will contain the `title`, `summary` and `content` fields as well as some meta information in the `_meta` field.
