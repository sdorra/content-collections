title: Configuration
---

Content Collections are configured using a single TypeScript file named `content-collections.ts` in the root of your project. The configuration file is a module that can define one or more collections.

## Collections

A collection defines how documents are read, validated, and transformed. Each collection can be created with the `defineCollection` function from `@content-collections/core` and receives an object with the following properties:

### `name` (required)

The name of the collection. The name is used to identify the collection and must be unique across all collections and singletons.

### `directory` (required)

The directory where the documents are stored. The directory must be relative to the root of the project.

### `include` (required)

A glob pattern or an array of glob patterns that define which files are included in the collection. The glob pattern is relative to the collection directory.
e.g.: `*.md`, `**/*.json`, `*.yaml`, `**/*.mdx`

### `exclude` (optional)

A glob pattern or an array of glob patterns that define which files are excluded from the collection. The glob pattern is relative to the collection directory.

### `parser` (optional)

The parser property is optional, and `frontmatter` is the default value.

The parser used to read the documents. The parser must be one of the following values:

| Type               | Description                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `frontmatter`      | Parses documents with frontmatter and content such as markdown or MDX. If the frontmatter parser is used a `content` property of type `string` should be defined in the schema. |
| `json`             | Parses JSON documents                                                                                                                                                           |
| `yaml`             | Parses YAML documents                                                                                                                                                           |
| `frontmatter-only` | Like `frontmatter`, but without content. Available since version 0.8.0.                                                                                                         |

The `frontmatter-only` parser is especially useful when only the metadata of a document is utilized with Content Collections, while the content is rendered by another source.

#### Custom Parser

If none of the parsers are fitting your needs, you can create a custom parser. This option is available since version 0.9.0. To create a custom parser, you have to import the `defineParser` function from `@content-collections/core` and create a parser either with only a function or with an object that contains a `parse` function and a `hasContent` property. If you only provide a function, the `hasContent` property is set to `false` by default. The `parse` function takes a single string as argument, the document, and should return an object with the parsed data or an `Promise` which contains the parsed data. The `hasContent` property is a boolean that indicates that content collection has to validate that the returned document has a property called `content`.

```typescript
import {
  defineCollection,
  defineConfig,
  defineParser,
} from "@content-collections/core";
import { z } from "zod";
import { parseXml } from "cool-xml-parser-library";

const customParser = defineParser(async (content) => {
  const result = await parseXml(content);
  return result.root;
});

const movies = defineCollection({
  name: "movies",
  directory: "movies",
  include: "*.xml",
  parser: customParser,
  schema: z.object({
    title: z.string(),
    description: z.string(),
  }),
});

export default defineConfig({
  content: [movies],
});
```

If you want to see a complete example of a custom parser, check the [Xml example](/samples/xml).

<Callout type="warn" title="Deprecation Notice">
  Adding the implicit content property to the resulting document is [deprecated](/docs/deprecations/implicit-content-property) and will be removed in the future.
  Once this feature is removed, the `hasContent` property in the custom parser will no longer be needed and will also be marked as deprecated.
  Therefore, if you want to use a custom parser, utilize the function-only syntax of `defineParser` to ensure your code remains future-proof.
</Callout>

### `typeName` (optional)

The name of the generated TypeScript type. If the `typeName` property is not provided, the type name is generated from the collection name.

### `schema` (required)

The `schema` property defines the structure of the documents collected by Content Collections. You can define the schema using any [Standard Schema](https://standardschema.dev/) [compatible library](https://standardschema.dev/#what-schema-libraries-implement-the-spec), such as [Zod](https://zod.dev/) or [Valibot](https://valibot.dev/). This schema validates the documents before they are added to the collection.

You can adjust the structure using the `transform` function. If not provided, TypeScript infers the type from the shape, which should consist only of [serializable](/docs/serialization) types.

The resulting shape validates the documents in the collection.
When using the `frontmatter` parser, the schema is validated against both the frontmatter and the document's content.
Therefore, a `content` property should exist alongside the frontmatter properties in the schema for the `frontmatter` parser.

Examples:

<Tabs groupId="schema-libs" items={["Zod", "Valibot", "ArkType"]} persist>
<Tab value="Zod">

```ts
import { z } from "zod";

// ...
schema: z.object({
  firstName: z.string(),
  lastName: z.string(),
  middleName: z.string().optional(),
  age: z.number(),
  email: z.string().email(),
  content: z.string(),
});
```

</Tab>
<Tab value="Valibot">

```ts
import * as v from "valibot";

// ...
schema: v.object({
  firstName: v.string(),
  lastName: v.string(),
  middleName: v.optional(v.string()),
  age: v.number(),
  email: v.pipe(v.string(), v.email()),
  content: v.string(),
});
```

</Tab>
<Tab value="ArkType">

```ts
import { type } from "arktype";

// ...
schema: type({
  firstName: "string",
  lastName: "string",
  middleName: "string?",
  age: "number",
  email: "string.email",
  content: "string",
});
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

### `transform` (optional)

The `transform` property is a function that transforms the document before it is saved.
It takes two arguments: the document and a context object, and should return the transformed document.
The "transform" function can be used to add computed properties, modify existing properties, or remove properties from the document.
It can also fetch data from a remote server, transform markdown to HTML, or even join collections.

The result type of the `transform` function defines the TypeScript type of the document. If the `transform` function is not provided, the document type is inferred from the schema.
It can be synchronous or asynchronous. The `transform` function is powerful, you can learn about the [Transform](/docs/transform) function.

Example:

```ts
transform: (doc) => ({
  ...doc,
  fullName: `${doc.firstName} ${doc.lastName}`,
});
```

### `onSuccess` (optional)

The `onSuccess` property is a function that is called after all documents are saved to the collection. It takes a single argument, an array of documents. The `onSuccess` function can be used to index the documents or to log messages. It can be synchronous or asynchronous.

Example:

```ts
onSuccess: (docs) => {
  console.log(`generated collection with ${docs.length}`);
};
```

## Singleton Object

A singleton is similar to a collection, but it only contains a single document. A singleton can be created with the `defineSingleton` function from `@content-collections/core`  and receives an object with the following properties:

### `name` (required)

The name of the singleton. The name is used to identify the singleton and must be unique across all collections and singletons.

### `filePath` (required)

The path to the file where the singleton document is stored. The path must be relative to the root of the project.

### `parser` (optional)

The parser is the same as for the [parser for collections](#parser-optional).

### `optional` (optional)

If set to `true`, the singleton file is optional. If the file is not found, the singleton will be set to `undefined`. By default, the singleton file is required, and an error is thrown if the file is not found. This option is useful for cases where the singleton file may not exist in all environments, such as a local development environment or a production environment.

### `schema` (required)

The schema is the same as for the [schema for collections](#schema-required).

### `transform` (optional)

The transform function is the same as for the [transform for collections](#transform-optional).

### `typeName` (optional)

The name of the generated TypeScript type. If the `typeName` property is not provided, the type name is generated from the singleton name.

## Configuration object

The configuration file is a module that has to export a configuration object as the default export. The configuration object can be created with the `defineConfig` function from `@content-collections/core` and receives an object with a property called content which contains an array of collection and singleton objects.

## Example

```ts
import { defineCollection, defineConfig } from "@content-collections/core";
import { z } from "zod";

const siteConfig = defineSingleton({
  name: "siteConfig",
  filePath: "content/site.yaml",
  parser: "yaml",
  optional: true,
  schema: z.object({
    title: z.string(),
    description: z.string(),
  }),
});

const authors = defineCollection({
  name: "authors",
  directory: "content/authors",
  parser: "yaml",
  include: "**/*.yaml",
  schema: z.object({
    firstName: z.string(),
    lastName: z.string(),
    middleName: z.string().optional(),
    age: z.number(),
    email: z.string().email(),
  }),
  transform: (doc) => ({
    ...doc,
    fullName: `${doc.firstName} ${doc.lastName}`,
  }),
  onSuccess: (docs) => {
    console.log(`generated collection with ${docs.length}`);
  },
});

export default defineConfig({
  content: [siteConfig, authors],
});
```
