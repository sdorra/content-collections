title: Deprecated Schema as Function
---

With version `0.9.0`, Content Collections now uses [Standard Schema](https://standardschema.dev/) for the `schema` property. This change allows you to utilize any [Standard Schema compatible library](https://standardschema.dev/#what-schema-libraries-implement-the-spec), such as [Zod](https://zod.dev/) or [Valibot](https://valibot.dev/), to define the schema.

Using a function as a schema was deprecated with version `0.9.0` and is removed within version `0.12.0`.
To adopt the new schema, you must install your chosen library and update the schema definition in your configuration.

Let's examine the following example:

The old, removed way of defining the schema:

```ts
import { defineCollection, defineConfig } from "@content-collections/core";

const posts = defineCollection({
  name: "posts",
  directory: "content",
  include: "*.md",
  schema: (z) => ({
    title: z.string(),
    date: z.string(),
  })
});

export default defineConfig({
  content: [posts],
});
```

If we want to continue using [Zod](https://zod.dev/) to define the schema, we first need to install the library:

```package-install
npm i zod
```

Then, import Zod and use it directly to define the schema:

```ts
import { defineCollection, defineConfig } from "@content-collections/core";
import { z } from "zod";

const posts = defineCollection({
  name: "posts",
  directory: "content",
  include: "*.md",
  schema: z.object({
    title: z.string(),
    date: z.string(),
  })
});

export default defineConfig({
  content: [posts],
});
```

And that's it! You have successfully migrated to the new schema format.
