title: Deprecated configuration property collections
---

With version `0.14.0`, Content Collections used to register sources using the `collections` property in `defineConfig`. This is now **deprecated** in favor of a clearer name: `content`.

## What is deprecated?

Old (deprecated):

```ts
import { defineCollection, defineConfig } from "@content-collections/core";

const posts = defineCollection({
  name: "posts",
  directory: "content/posts",
  include: "*.md",
  schema: z.object({
    title: z.string(),
    content: z.string(),
  }),
});

export default defineConfig({
  content: [posts],
});
```

New (recommended):

```ts
import { defineCollection, defineConfig } from "@content-collections/core";

const posts = defineCollection({
  name: "posts",
  directory: "content/posts",
  include: "*.md",
  schema: z.object({
    title: z.string(),
    content: z.string(),
  }),
});

const settings = defineSingleton({
  name: "settings",
  filePath: "content/settings.json",
  parser: "json",
  schema: z.object({
    theme: z.enum(["light", "dark"]),
  }),
});

export default defineConfig({
  content: [posts, settings],
});
```

## Why?

`collections` is misleading because you can also register **singletons** (a single document) alongside collections. `content` is a better umbrella term for both.

## Suppressing Deprecation Warning

If you are not ready to migrate yet, you can suppress the warning:

```ts
import { suppressDeprecatedWarnings } from "@content-collections/core";

suppressDeprecatedWarnings("collectionsConfigProperty");
```
